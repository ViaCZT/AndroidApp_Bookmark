# Lab 7: Android Studio 1

This lab, you will be making a simple bookmarking application.

A lot of the content is covered in the Android Lecture. If you're not certain if you're doing something correctly, give it a (re-)watch!

Some students encounter errors regarding the HAXM Manager, so we have supplied some [troubleshooting information](Troubleshooting.md).



## Agenda

- [ ] **[Task 1: Layout](Task1Layout.md)**: Create the application, and give it a responsive layout.
- [ ] **[Task 2: Functionality](Task2Functionality.md)**: Add the functionality to add, list, and view bookmarks.
- [ ] **Submission:** I have had my code marked by a tutor in my lab *(see below for details)*

Note: putting an 'x' in the third box above is required for the Gitlab CI to pass.


## Submission notes

Both tasks are assessable, and worth one mark each.

Submission functions differently for this lab: you **must** demonstrate your code to your tutor to be assessed, **and** push your code to GitLab. Read the **Submission notes** section below for more details.

***Assignment deadline***: See the deadline on Wattle, as always.

**Submission mode**: via demonstration to your lab tutor during your lab in week 6 or 7; and via your GitLab fork of this repository.

**Submission guidelines checklist**:

2. Committed and pushed your final code to your fork
3. Be marked off by your tutor in your lab session
4. Passed the CI

### Important
Violation of submission guidelines 1-4 will result in zero marks. If you can't work out why your CI isn't passing, ask your tutor (or post on Wattle).
